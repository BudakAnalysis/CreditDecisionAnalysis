Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing anonymized credit approval data and developing a classification model to predict credit approval decisions. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning model development.

Key Aspects of the Project:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions, feature correlations, and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Optimized dataset by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

Model Training & Evaluation: Built and compared multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, etc.) using cross-validation and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Insights & Decision Making: Evaluated model performance, discussed overfitting/underfitting, and provided insights into credit approval decision-making.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Impact: This project demonstrates a structured approach to predictive modeling for financial decision-making and highlights key skills in data science and machine learning.

Dataset: Credit Approval from UCI Machine Learning Depository
